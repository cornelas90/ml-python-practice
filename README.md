# ml-python-practice
This repo is simply me following along with Muller & Guido's 'Introduction to Machine Learning with Python' to get a better grasp of different machine learning methodologies.
Starting with the decision-tree.py file, I try to make each block of code more isolated so you don't have to jump up and check the imported libraries.
Other than that, I stick pretty closely to the example problems in text. Just getting my feet wet!
